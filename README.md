## UI development

Developing the UI is simple.

> **Prerequisite** have nodejs installed

Open a terminal to the `/ui-src` folder within this folder

Run the following command
`npm install`

Now run
`npm start`

A browser window will open, displaying the UI.

Make changes to the Javascript in `ui-src/src`, and save the files, and your
changes will appear with live reloading in the browser window.
